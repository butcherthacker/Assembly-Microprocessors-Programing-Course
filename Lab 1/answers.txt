Answers for Lab 1

Task 1
The programs behaviour is identical regardless of whether the constant value is expressed as 0xE in hex or 14 in decimal.


Task 2
Yes, it is completely legal to add r3 to the value in the register r3 and put the resulting value back into the register r3. In this case we get 8 + 8 = 16 in R3.

Task 3
It isn't legal to add two constants to a register in a single line add instruction. If we replace the middle operand with a register instead of a constant, then it does work.
